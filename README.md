# AML-CoVe
University of Oxford - Advanced Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge. Contextualized Word Vectors (CoVe) - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00107.pdf

Tensorflow 2.0-alpha is used

To train the models, first train the NMT.
Next, the CoVe encodings can be generated using the GetEncodings script. 
Lastly, the weights are loaded into the BCN.
